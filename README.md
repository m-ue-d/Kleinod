<h2 align="left">What's so special about it?</h2>
It is supposed to be lightweight, easy to use and especially useful for layered sidescrolleres. (Like some levels in <a href="https://www.nintendo.at/Spiele/Nintendo-Switch-Spiele/Super-Mario-Bros-Wonder-2404150.html">Mario Wonder</a>, where the level has some depth that the player can explore)

<h2 align="left">What's a layered sidescroller in your mind?</h1>
A layered sidescroller is like any normal sidescroller, but has "3D" features in the shape of layers. Like a mixture of "Sonic the Hedgehog" and "Dwarf Fortress" if you want a direct example. 

<h2 align="left">Isn't this kind of useless?</h2>
It may seem that way for an outsider, but know these points:
  
- I want to properly learn C++.
- I kind of like game dev.
- This is a fun side project made for myself =)
