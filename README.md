<h2 align="left">What's so special about it?</h2>
It is supposed to be lightweight, easy to use and especially useful for layered sidescrolleres. (I know that this genre doesn't exist; so i made it a thing and now it does)

<h2 align="left">What's a layered sidescroller in your mind?</h1>
A layered sidescroller is like any normal sidescroller, but has "3D" features in the shape of layers. Like a mixture of "Sonic the Hedgehog" and "Dwarf Fortress" if you want a direct example. 

<h2 align="left">Why are you doing this to your psyche?</h2>
I want to learn c++.
